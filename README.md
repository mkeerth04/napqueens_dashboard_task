# napqueens_dashboard_task
A dashboard task given by napqueen

initially i started downloading and installing node js and install react in my pc
after installing react, i opened terminal or command prompt and created a new directory for my project.
After doing the process navigate to the project directory and initialize a new React project using the following command: "npx create-react-app dashboard"
Then we have to change current directory to the project directory: "cd dashboard"
Then i opened my project in Visual Studio and started working on it.

For installing the dependencies:
Installing Antd-UI, a popular Design library for React,executed by: "npm install antd"
After that i installed node-sass, a library that allows to use SCSS in React components:"npm install node-sass"

For creating dashboard compenents:
Initially I surfed everything in the material UI and viewed all components and their dependencies and working process and style and framework of it.
In src folder I created a new folder named components
Inside the components folder, create the necessary React components for dashboard, such as Sidebar, Header, MainContent, etc. 

Implementing Material-UI and SCSS styling:
Import the necessary Antd-UI components and styles into React components:"import { Button } from 'antd';"
Use SCSS to style components. Create SCSS files for each component or create a single SCSS file to hold all styles.
Import the SCSS files into your React components using the import statement, like this: "import './ComponentName.scss';"
Apply the CSS classes from SCSS files to the appropriate elements in your React components.

Building dashboard:
Combining components and layouts in the App.js file and 
execute this command in termincal:"npm start"
Open web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see dashboard.
