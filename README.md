# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Step 1: Set up the project

Initially I installed Node.js on my computer.
After installing it open terminal or command prompt and create a new directory for project.
Navigate to the project directory and initialize a new React project using the following command:
"npx create-react-app dashboard"
I Changed current my directory to the project directory by using this command:"cd dashboard"
Then open project in visual studio

Step 2: Install dependencies

I installed Ant Design and its required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:
"npm install antd"
After that I installed node-sass, a library that allows you to use SCSS in React components:
"npm install node-sass"

Step 3: Create the dashboard components

In the src folder, create a new folder called components.
Inside the components folder, I create the necessary React components for dashboard, such as Sidebar, Header, MainContent, etc.

Step 4: Implement Ant Design and SCSS styling

I imported the necessary Ant Design components and styles into React components.
I used SCSS to style components. Create SCSS files for each component or create a single SCSS file to hold all your styles.
I imported the SCSS files into React components using the import statement, like this:"import './ComponentName.scss';"
Then I apply the CSS classes from my SCSS files to the appropriate elements in your React components.

Step 5: Build the dashboard layout and run and test it

Then i started the development server by running the following command in my terminal:"npm start"
It will navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see it.

I wouldnâ€™t able to deploy this react app , I apology for that
Anyhow this is the outcome of my work
Please do consider this

Even I have tired doing it in material.io framework that code is in Dashboard.js, but I couldn.t able to further continue with it so I tried a new framework (antd) and worked on in it 
My code is in the App.js file using antd framework
